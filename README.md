# py2048
IvLabs 2048 project


initially when game starts the player is asked to choose which grid he wanted to play
"enter boardsize"

now a board with random numbers(2,4) appear in choosen grid in random places

main work is to move left, up, right, down, and merge similar numbers and finally make 2048 number

keys to move numbers in grid: left "a"
                              right "d"
                              up "w"
                              down "s"
                              
now similar numbers merge and becomes double

when there are no spaces to merge the game declares that player is "lost"

or when player gets 2048 in board he/she is declared "win"
